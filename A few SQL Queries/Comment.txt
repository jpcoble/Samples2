These stored procedures and function are pretty old (about 3 years). I was over-excited about SQL Server at the time. 
In more recent times, I have used SQL Server just to get the data right for Excel when it comes to calculations since
I often need to make changes to formulas on the fly, while a client is sitting in front of me. Excel is better-fitted
for such creativity with numbers in quick situations. 

While I have been using Excel for about 20 years (Lotus 1-2-3 before),
there are actually some calculations that are better done in SQL Server. An example would be the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy
Pot Test. Excel seems too "flat" for the task. I wish I could find the SQL that I once wrote for the Pot Test. Most mortgage
companies still do not have software that is up to the task and even if they did, they would need a web-service (maybe Rest)
to link to the Trustee's data. It is difficult to exeplain, but the fact is, if you have both pro rata secured payments
AND fixed secured payments (secured fixed payments are een most of the time after the 2005 act); almost every part of the calculation can
change on a monthly basis. You might call it a very "unstable" and "multi-dimensional" amortization. As a matter of fact,
Creditors prefer "fixed" payments over "pro rata" payments even though secured creditors would normally be paid quicker
with "pro rata." The reason they prefer "fixed" payments is because they can not figure out how to account for "pro rata"
payments. I do not know if the National Data Center (keeps up with all Chapter 13 bankruptcies) provides a Rest service
for creditors. If such a service is not provided, they should scrape the National Data Center. Just don't ask me to write
the scraper or the SQL. I work ONLY for the debtors.
