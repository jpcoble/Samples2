        echo '<Say voice="alice" language="en-GB">In a Chapter 7 Straight Bankruptcy, your non-exempt assets are sold by the Chapter 7 Trustee in order to liquidate your debts. The great thing is that only about 1 out of 100 Chapter 7 Bankruptcies has any non exempt assets. Therefore, you lose debt, but none of your property. Some debts are not discharged in Chapter 7 Bankruptcies For example most student loans, some taxes, and child support. In a Chapter 7, if you want to keep the collateral, you must continue to pay for your secured debts. For example, if you have a car loan and you want to keep the car, you must continue to pay for it.

Another Procedure used in the bankruptcy court is a Chapter 13 Debt Consolidation. In a Chapter 13 debt consolidation, you make a monthly payment to the Chapter 13 trustee for the elimination of all your debts. Depending on your circumstances, the trustee may pay nothing to the unsecured creditors (such as credit cards and medical bills), yet still completely eliminate those debts. A Chapter 13 can be useful if you are behind on your car payment or mortgage payment, if you have a high interest rate on your car, if you have debts that are not dischargeable in a Chapter 7 or if you would lose property in a Chapter 7. The monthly payment in a Chapter 13 debt consolidation can often be less than your car payment and at the same time include your car payment.
